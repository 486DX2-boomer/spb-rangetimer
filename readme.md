# SPB Range Timer

An array of server-side stopwatches for shooting range use.

CTRL + Shift + H to hide the control buttons. This is intended to be used for the screens inside the range and provides a cleaner look to customers.

## To Do

- [ ] ~~Start~~, ~~Stop~~, ~~Clear Timer~~, Half Hour, Hour, Custom Time Interval (Hour, half hour, or arbitrary time), ~~Reserved for Member~~, ~~Out of Order~~
- [ ] Add expiration behavior to timers (timers should stay at 0:00 and clear manually instead of auto clearing)
- [ ] Having an array of 21 timers starting at 1 and ending at 20 is kind of iffy, don't know if I want to do 0-19 and then translate the value at the frontend. Either way is confusing
- [ ] Refactor this so I send one request and get the state of all 20 timers with one request instead of sending 20 requests every second (But I couldn't figure out how)
- [ ] Get timer index from GET request logic (`timerIndex := strings.Split(ti, "/start/")[1]`) rewritten into a generic
- [ ] Toggling timer flags (reserved, member, out of order) are currently all separate functions, rewrite into a generic
- [x] All of the front end work (has to look good because customers will see it)
- [x] Figure out how to call Refresh() without typing the URL in (lol)
- [x] Front end fetch the timers from the server and display them in DOM
  - [x] Do not know how to refresh this every second- a fetch request every second? Sounds expensive
- [x] Convert integer to time (3600 seconds == 1 hour on screen)
- [x] Hide Timer Buttons (For range use, so savvy customers don't reset their own timers)

## Code Snippets

*Emoji button setup*
```     
<button onclick="startTimer('1')">‚ñ∂</button>
<button onclick="stopTimer('1')">||</button>
<button onclick="clearTimer('1')">‚ØÄ</button>
<!-- Out of Order -->
<button>‚ùå</button>
<!-- Member -->
<button>ü§¥</button>
<!-- Reservation -->
<button>üõé</button>
```

*Format seconds as an integer value into a stopwatch value*

I like this answer. It can be even shorter: 
```
new Date(1000 * seconds).toISOString().substr(11, 8)
```

No, I don't know how to make Javascript buttons off the top of my head. Javascript is a bad and I avoid learning it at ALL COSTS.
